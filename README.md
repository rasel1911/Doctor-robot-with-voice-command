Intelligent Robotic Assistant for Real-Time Healthcare: Emotion Analysis, Symptom Detection and Medication Suggestions .

This project outlines the development of a sophisticated healthcare assistance robot, designed to aid in diagnostics and personalized treatment recommendations. This system integrates real-time emotion detection, face recognition, object recognition, and symptom analysis to deliver a comprehensive patient assessment. A primary feature of this robot is its capability to identify emotions and diagnose symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in real-time.Leveraging these analyses, the robot provides targeted medicine recommendations, drawing on a 
structured database of potential treatments stored in JSON format. For additional flexibility, the robot is equipped with "Gemini," a knowledge retrieval module that 
dynamically connects to the internet to retrieve medical information and symptom details not stored locally. Gemini enables the robot to respond to user inquiries with up-to-date data, 
enhancing the device’s ability to address a broad range of health concerns. In addition, the robot’s web server connectivity allows it to extend its functionality by securely accessing remote treatment resources and facilitating patient interaction through voice output, ensuring a seamless and accessible user experience. This report provides a detailed examination of the robot's architecture, including its data processing algorithms, interaction protocols, and real-time operational capabilities. Emphasis is placed on the device’s innovative approach to automated health monitoring and treatment guidance, highlighting its potential applications in both clinical and non-clinical settings. The described system represents a step forward in medical robotics, combining intelligent diagnostics with user-centered design to create a valuable tool for modern healthcare.
